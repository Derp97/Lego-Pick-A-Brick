# Lego Pick-A-Brick Scraper
## Overview
This Python script is designed to get all active parts on the Lego Pick-A-Brick website, gathering such information as the Element ID, Design number, part name, colour id and current price.

## Results
The outputted file is in the csv format, and can be used in conjunction with a VLOOKUP for searching the current Lego Pick-A-Brick parts, enabling Lego customers to be able to quickly search and create a list of parts that can be added into an order.

This is a handy tool for people requiring new and genuine lego parts for their various reasons e.g aquiring parts to build a MOC.
